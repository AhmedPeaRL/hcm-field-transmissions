# hcm-field-transmissions

This repository does not distribute products.

It records states of presence,
and allows transmissions to occur elsewhere
without instruction, promotion, or claim.

Nothing here asks to be received.
Nothing here insists on value.

If something appears beyond this field,
it was permitted — not pushed.
